# LeetCodeSolutionsTracker

My personal repository to track and note down all leetcode solutions I have done! <br>

Solutions will be done in Python, here is a list of the ones I have accomplished so far:

### Easy Questions

- Two Sum (Array)
- Palindrome Number (String)
- Best Time to Buy and Sell a Stock (Array)
- Roman to Integer (String)
- Merge Strings Alternately (String)
- Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (Binary Trees)
- Contains Duplicate (Array)
- Merge Strings Alternately (Strings)
- First Letter Twice (Strings)
- First Bad Version (Binary Search)
- Can Place Flower (Array)
- Unique Number of Occurrences (Array)
- Reverse a Linked List (Linked List)
- Most Frequent Number Following Key in an Array (Array)
- Reverse Vowels of a String (String)
- Valid Parentheses (Stack and Hash Map for String)
- Is Subsequence (Simple String)
- Is Valid Anagram (Hashmaps for each String)
- Valid Palindrome (String with Two Pointers)
- Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String (Fixed Length Sliding Window in String)
- Same Tree (Preorder DFS on Binary Trees)
- Inorder Binary Tree Traversal (Inorder DFS on Binary Tree)
- Symmetric Tree (DFS on two subtrees of the same Binary Tree)
- Remove Duplicates In-Place (Arrays no extra memory)
- Set Mismatch (Set and Array Question)
- Search Insert Position (Binary Search w/ special return low value)
- Kids with the Greatest Number of Candies (Sorting and Run through)
- Length of Last Word (Start from end of String, track spaces seen)
- Baseball Game (Stack with some peeking)
- Search in BST (Simple BST Ordering Search)
- Majority Element (Hashmap and Count)
- Max Consecutive Ones (Simple Streak Counting In-Place)
- Intersection of 2 Arrays (2 Sets keep track of one, other holds intersection elements)
- Reverse String (2 Pointers Easy)
- First Unique Char (Hashtable Count Letters in String)

### Medium Questions

- Longest Substring Wihtout Repeating Characters (String)
- Product of Array Except Self (Array)
- Maximum Subarray (Sliding Window, Prefix Negative Tracking)
- Add Two Numbers (LinkedList keep track of reversals, use strings to keep track of numbers)
- Group Anagrams (HT Key is a lowercase letter counter, value is the strings that match this key, return HT values in an array)
- Anagrams in a String (Similar to Group Anagrams question, use set to filter duplicate words)
- Top K Frequent Element (Currently brute forced with QS and Hashmap, optiimize with modified bucket sort!)

### Hard Questions
